# Bayesian ML Questions

## Q-1
Let us say we want to find likelihood of following result out of a fair-coin flip experiment.
$$
R = \{H,T,H,H,T,H,T,T,H,H\}
$$
Probability of $H=6$ and $T=4$ in this experiment is given by Binomial probabilities,
$$
p(H=6,T=4|\theta=0.5) = {10\choose6}(0.5)^6(0.5)^4 
$$

But, likelihood of our result is given by Bernoulli likelihood equation,
$$
p(R|\theta=0.5) = (0.5)^6(0.5)^4
$$

Why the $10\choose6$ term is not present in the likelihood probability?
