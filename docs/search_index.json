If it turns out \\(H\\), you win \\(1\\$\\), and for \\(T\\), you lose \\(1\\$\\). Try to answer the following questions if one plays the game \\(N\\) times, when i) \\(N=5\\) ii) \\(N=6\\). What is the likelihood of winning \\(N\\$\\)? What is the likelihood of winning \\(0\\$\\)? You believed that the coin is fair, but you found from your secret sources that \\(p(H)=0.5, p(H)=0.3\\), and \\(p(H)=0.8\\) are all equally possible for any coin. Given that a person won \\(4\\$\\) after playing the game \\(6\\) times, what is the probability that he had a coin with \\(p(H)=0.8\\)?
